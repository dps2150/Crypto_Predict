# Abstract
This paper aims to predict future prices of Bitcoin using daily sample price data
between January 02, 2019 and March 31, 2021. The volatility index (VIX) is
used to divide the analysis period into normal and abnormal market conditions.
This paper analyzes the performance of both an Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) and Long Term-Short Memory (LSTM) networks. The LSTM is
commonly used in financial time series and is known for its ability to learn relevant
dependency order, making it a powerful tool for trend recognition. The ARIMA
model is utilized as the baseline for comparison against the “more-advanced”
LSTM model. This paper finds that both ARIMA and LSTM models are suitable
candidates for a long-term, risk-averse strategy. However, the ARIMA model
currently seems to be the best choice as a predictive base for trading Bitcoin.
